# Synopsis
  Hyperfocus is a common symptom of ADHD that involves a complete absorption of one's focus into a task. This, on the surface, can be seen as a superpower. After all, who wouldn't want to focus a ton on the thing they're trying to accomplish? Hyperfocus can lead someone to neglect important things in their life, including eating, sleeping, going to the bathroom, and doing tasks such as laundry or taking out the trash. These are the hidden negatives of hyperfocus, and is part of the reason this symptom is not entirely favorable. As a person with ADHD myself, hyperfocus manifests in highly engaging activities, which is more often then not something like video games. This can result in the majority of a day being spent playing games, and in terms of productivity, that is a day wasted.
  
  When making this project, I started by putting the subject of hyperfocus in the middle and making the background black. I wanted to add some contrast between the text, him, and everything else, so the remaining things were dimmed into the back, like they were hidden in the shadows. I wanted to paint both how hyperfocus works and how it can be misunderstood as a superpower, so I "hid" the consequences of it onto the sides. I really want to make it seem enticing at first, only for the viewer to be put off as they look at it more. I also added the hungry dog as a nod to the viewer's pathos, as nobody likes to see a hungry dog. For each of the images, I had to remove the background using the fuzzy select tool, and for the text I added a copy of the text behind it with a gaussian blur.
